# LOW-COST SENSOR FOR SEAMLESS ROAD QUALITY MONITORING

Abstract
In this project, our group designed a low-cost sensor to collect road data, aiming at conveniently
reporting the quality of seamless roads. To achieve this target, we designed an
inexpensive device with an accelerometer and a GPS chip. Our device could be fixed on
the bicycle with a device holder and then transmit data to the server. Machine learning
models have been created to process acceleration data and judge the road quality. When
abnormal patterns appeared, message where the patterns locate would be produced and
sent to our display system. Locations with problems could be visualized on a city map
constantly and could be accessible for users via web browsers as clients.
